            <p>The giant pandas, Da Mao and Er Shun, are preparing for their journey home to China, where bamboo is abundant and local, and are not available for viewing. The Calgary Zoo's PandaCam, presented by Hainan Airlines, is currently offline at this time as well. Er Shun and Da Mao have become cherished members of the Calgary Zoo family and will be deeply missed by staff, volunteers, the community and our visitors from around the world. <br><br>We are so grateful for the generosity of the donors and sponsors that made it possible for the giant pandas to come to the Calgary Zoo. Er Shun and Da Mao will be deeply missed by staff, volunteers, donors and visitors from around the world.  Knowing a second wave of COVID-19 is likely, and the bamboo supply chain challenges will continue to negatively impact the zoo’s ability to bring bamboo to the giant pandas, the Calgary Zoo feels it’s critical to move the beloved giant pandas back to China where there are abundant local sources of bamboo as soon as possible.</p>
